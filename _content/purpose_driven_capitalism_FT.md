# The limits of the pursuit of profit
Andrew Hill, 09-23-2019

* In februray 2016, Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone pushed to shift half Danone's product to non-GMO ingrediients (improve soil health and biodiversity)
* There is a shift in the way that large companies think about their purpose and responsibilities
* For 40 or more years, businesses latched on Milton Friedman's [The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html) but the tide is changing
* Businesses that combine profit with a wider purpose will benefit from the reinforced commitment of employees and customers
* One of the main criticisms is that it allows executives to set their own criteria for success and let them off the hook for poor financial performance
* factors driving companies towards asserting a broader purpose:
	- desire to offset a lack of trust in business that has lingered beyond the end of the financial crisis
	- younger candidates will shun employers that cannot prove they have a positive purpose
	- people want companies to replace the role of a government that led them down
	- growing appetite for investors to back companies that are taking **E**nvironmental, **S**ocial and **G**overnance measures
	- pure self-interest (as critics pointed out): this could merely be a way of seeing off the threat of new legislation and regulation
	- tackling the risks that unbridled growth might pose to the communities that buy their product 
* Prof Ioannis Ioannou shows "the ones that fall behind in adopting best practices are the ones whose performance gets hit in the long run"
* Nike, attacked over its suppliers' working conditions in the 1990s, improved standards and developped a new manufacturing process to take pressure off the old supply chain
* Japanese companies profess a strong sense of corporate mission and long-termism, to such a degree that they sometimes use it to cover up lackluster short-term results
* US and UK generally face the opposite charge
