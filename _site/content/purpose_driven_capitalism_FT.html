<ul>
  <li>In februray 2016, Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone pushed to shift half Danone’s product to non-GMO ingrediients (improve soil health and biodiversity)</li>
  <li>There is a shift in the way that large companies think about their purpose and responsibilities</li>
  <li>For 40 or more years, businesses latched on Milton Friedman’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html">The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits</a> but the tide is changing</li>
  <li>Businesses that combine profit with a wider purpose will benefit from the reinforced commitment of employees and customers</li>
  <li>One of the main criticisms is that it allows executives to set their own criteria for success and let them off the hook for poor financial performance</li>
  <li>factors driving companies towards asserting a broader purpose:
    <ul>
      <li>desire to offset a lack of trust in business that has lingered beyond the end of the financial crisis</li>
      <li>younger candidates will shun employers that cannot prove they have a positive purpose</li>
      <li>people want companies to replace the role of a government that led them down</li>
      <li>growing appetite for investors to back companies that are taking <strong>E</strong>nvironmental, <strong>S</strong>ocial and <strong>G</strong>overnance measures</li>
      <li>pure self-interest (as critics pointed out): this could merely be a way of seeing off the threat of new legislation and regulation</li>
      <li>tackling the risks that unbridled growth might pose to the communities that buy their product</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prof Ioannis Ioannou shows “the ones that fall behind in adopting best practices are the ones whose performance gets hit in the long run”</li>
  <li>Nike, attacked over its suppliers’ working conditions in the 1990s, improved standards and developped a new manufacturing process to take pressure off the old supply chain</li>
  <li>Japanese companies profess a strong sense of corporate mission and long-termism, to such a degree that they sometimes use it to cover up lackluster short-term results</li>
  <li>US and UK generally face the opposite charge</li>
