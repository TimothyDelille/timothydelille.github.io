# About me

I am currently working as senior data scientist at PwC AI Labs. I focus on information extraction on unstructured document using deep learning methods as well as belief propagation in Bayesian Networks using Dempster-Shafer theory to model uncertainty.

I also happen to be passionate about piano jazz and martial arts.
